      Ruggedwerx Project

    <h3>A Wyoming Inc. project</h3>
    <p>
This was a project built during my time with Wyoming Inc.; I was responsible for building out the front-end of a Wordpress website, based on a design mockup. I had a lot of fun building this website, I used Javascript (jQuery), CSS, and PHP, with a delightful team of experts.
