# BENGRONEMAN.TECH

This is a SPA (Single Page Application) that is currently hosted using Netlify, and can be found at this [link](https://bengroneman.tech)
I built this site out of a love for code, and a fondness for Vue (JavaScript). I enjoy writing clean code, and this repository will be a lifelong representation of that.

## This website was built leveraging the following open source technologies

>[Vue](https://github.com/vuejs)

> [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) -> **Note this is a dependency you should have, if you want to run this website locally**

>[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)

>[Vue-Particles](https://github.com/creotip/vue-particles)

>[express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
